# Introduction

This is a collection of demos demonstrating capabilities of locally running LLMs like llama3 in combination with open source frameworks like haystack.

These attempt to demonstrate how you can use LLMs to automate tasks such as handling customer complaints or performing (up to now) challenging analysis like sentiment analysis and meaning extraction.

Large language models can be used to assist businesses in decreasing reliance on workforce for performing simple tasks that can be automated. They can also be used (in controlled environments) to empower employees to do more with their time.

# Usage of LLMs in customer facing roles

LLMs have proven to be excellent at generating text that is engaging and interesting to read while at the same time they are compliant with instructions. This makes them an excellent choice for improving communications via asynchronous means enabling organisations to take time and review the communication before sharing it with a customer.

Currently, there are no guarantees that messages generated by LLMs would not be offensive and reputational risk associated with such incident is large. However, it is perfectly viable to enable employees of an organisation to use custom built tools to be empowered to do more with their time.
