I have tried on several occasions to request refunds from 118 118 for transactions that I had processed. One had been a show I attended which went really badly, was chaotic and awful. I had contacted the organisers of the event asking for my refund and because they are based outside the country, they declined refund. Naturally I went to my credit card company (118) who refused to refund the money stating “you attended the event, it wasn’t cancelled” and declined to help me further.Second time I made a payment for a holiday thinking I was paying for a deposit only to realise a full payment was taken from my card. Within 12hrs of getting the notification I contacted 118 asking them to reverse the payment. I was told we can’t because it’s still showing as pending. When it was cleared I rang 118 begging them to cancel the payment as it was a genuine mistake. I was I told we don’t do that because the company did not cancel the holiday. What is the point of having a credit card? This company is very very unhelpful and extremely unfair. After finishing my payment I will be cancelling my credit card account.
