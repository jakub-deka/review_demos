Absolutely disgraceful treatment of their customers struggling to pay one payment. I am currently in Australia having relocated and as such, have changed jobs and have unfortunately not been able to pay last months payment. I proactively emailed the customer service email address to tell them about this and advise I would make double payment this month.  I have received daily emails from a no reply address and texts from a no reply number demanding I pay or they will take legal action. I have emailed multiple times to the only email address I can find on the internet. I can’t access their website as they block IPs outside of UK and I cannot download the app as it’s only available on the UK App Store. What am I meant to do?! Terrible customer service. All I have asked for is your bank details so I can pay the outstanding monthly amount, and I am being bombarded by automated abuse.
