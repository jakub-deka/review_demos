Really bad customer service & experience.I have a good credit history and credit score - Experian and Equifax are happy that I have the all the particulars I need, but 118118 declined right at the last moment for a reason they don't even know and can not explain.When I asked to speak with someone that can help me understand that decision - because it makes no sense whatsoever - the customer service representative (if that's what you want to call it) told me that there was no one to speak with and hung up on me.There are many many service providers out there with a better understanding of their own business and the ethical requirements as a service provider - Use them instead!

I would like to take this opportunity to understand the issue better and see if we can find a solution that works for you. Would you please contact our complaints team at complaints@118118money.com so that we can discuss this further?

Sincerely,
