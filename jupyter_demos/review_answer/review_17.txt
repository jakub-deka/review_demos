Dear Consumer,

I am reaching out to you directly as we take all complaints seriously and would like to better understand your experience with our company. Despite previous attempts, it appears that your concerns have not been fully addressed. I want to assure you that we value your time and effort in bringing this matter to our attention.

We understand that a swift resolution is crucial, particularly when it comes to matters affecting credit scores. I would like to encourage you to contact our dedicated complaints team at complaints@118118money.com, so we can investigate further and work towards a prompt resolution.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like us to address or any additional information you're willing to provide. Your input will be invaluable in helping us improve our processes and ensure that similar issues do not occur in the future.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Black, Senior Engagement Manager
