Wouldn't let me go on my account whilst I'm on holiday, ignored my emails but still keep sending me arrears emails.. why don't you sort it out so people can get on the website or app when they are on holiday. What happens if my card gets stolen.. do I just wait until I get home?Update: After a complaint was raised, again 118 closed it stating I had never emailed them. So I replied with the evidence (screenshot of my sent emails) and then they started ignoring me again. I find that they try and avoid you when you are right and can prove it, they would of seen my sent emails so clearly they lied.
