The worst company I have ever know. They take money out of your account with out your permission just because it’s been used to make a payment once. After they have told them to take the account off the system they then take a payment again so clearly haven’t. When you call to speak to someone they aren’t helpful. They give you different values that you owe as a payment. After taking money out of an account they don’t have authorisation on, say you owe the amount again then when you pay that money still hound you with multiple calls per day. When you speak to them they say “every manager is a meeting” they then end your call. Even worse communication and telephone manor than British Gas and that’s saying something. Everyone avoid at all costs
