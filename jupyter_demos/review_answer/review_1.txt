Absolute cowboys, customer help desk is a joke if you get through, try to rip you off as much as they can . I tried to close my account ( which they make increasingly difficult ) the person on the end of the phone had no idea and was trying to tell me I owed more than I did and when I questioned it they put it down to computer error !!!! Tried to complain to the complaints department and got standard canâ€™t help you apology
