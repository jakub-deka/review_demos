I was accepted for a loan of 2500 pounds over 3 years. Signed the forms gave them my bank details and card details as i was told id been approved. Gave them all the information they requested to be then told declined. Shocking service and system in place as they also done hard credit check which is now on my file. I want this removed as i didnt recieve the product after a hard credit check.
