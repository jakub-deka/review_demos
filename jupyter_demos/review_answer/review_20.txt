I had a loan with them in a desperate situation for very short term. When I wanted to settle the loan within a month they kept telling me they would send me the quote but no one sent me anything. The app doesn't work and keeps taking monthly money.

I'd like to learn more about the situation you're describing, where you were trying to settle the loan within a month but didn't receive the quote as promised. Additionally, I've taken note that you mentioned issues with our app and concerns about monthly payments being taken without your consent.

To better assist you, I would appreciate it if you could contact us directly so we can further investigate this matter together. You can reach out to our complaints team at complaints@118118money.com or give us a call.

I look forward to speaking with you soon and working towards finding a solution that meets your needs.
