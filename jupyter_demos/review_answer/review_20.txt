Really unhappy. Loan ended and they still took a full payment! Had to contact them myself. Waited ages to speak to someone who struggled to understand me, there was a clear language barrier. The refund for the overpayment isn't instant and I have to wait for it. The advisor wasn't understanding or compassionate regarding the clear issue. Raised a complaint to be advised they have over 4 weeks to respond. Disgusting Update:A complaint was only raised today. Even though I asked the agent on the day to raise a complaint. Joke of a company.
